#useMetadataEnrichment=false
# -----------------------------------
# Data copy rules
# -----------------------------------
# Data copy rules may be used to copy Kitodo internal data and metadata.
# Copying can be done either on catalogue query or on DMS export.
# A copy rule consists of a location to assign the data to, an assignment
# operator and a location to get the data from, separated by blanks. Multiple
# copy rules are separated using semicolon (;). Available operators are:
#
#    =    The value from the right hand side will be set on the left hand side.
#         An existing value will be overwritten. If the right hand side doesn't
#         exist, nothing happens.
#
#   ""=   Copies right to left in case that the right hand side exists and the
#         left hand side's path is available, but the metadatum is NOT YET SET
#         on the corresponding
#
# =format Creates a value as defined by String.format(String, Object...) and
#         sets it on the left hand side. An existing value will be overwritten.
#         The first argument is used as format string, the other arguments are
#         inserted into the format string as defined by the format string.
#         If the inserted arguments have an argument index, they are converted
#         to conform to the argument category required for the respective
#         conversion. If the right hand side doesn't exist, nothing happens.
#
# Right hand side expressions can be variable, metadata, string or destination
# reference selectors. Left hand side expressions can only be metadata
# selectors.
#
# A variable selector is a $ sign followed by the java classes' field name(s).
# Several fields can be chained. The result will be the result of the function
# String.valueOf(Object) invoked on the last field of the chain. Examples:
#       $process.id                     # Process ID
#       $process.docket.file            # File name of docket
#       $process.projekt.titel          # Title of digitisation project
#
# Notes: On catalogue query, "process" refers to the origin process (template)
#        whereas on DMS export "process" refers to the process being exported.
#        From v. 1.11 on, if DMS export is performed from by an automatic step
#        "process" will be an object of class de.sub.goobi.persistence.apache.
#        ProcessObject whose contents differ from de.sub.goobi.beans.Prozess,
#        so variable selectors will evaluate differently.
#
# Metadata selectors are specified as paths though the logical structure
# element tree. They use forward slashes "/" as separators, where a single
# slash references to the top level. "*" may be used for "any element", square
# braces may be used for referring to a certain element by its index.
# [>] refers to the last available index. For the left hand side of =format,
# [*] refers to all elements. The metadata element to be read or set is
# attached after an at ("@") symbol.Examples:
#       /@TitleDocMain                  # Main title of top struct
#       /*[0]@CurrentNoSorting          # Order number of first child
#       /Chapter[*]@TitleDocMain        # Main title of all chapters
#
# Strings can be used as arguments. They must be double-qoted (""). Example:
#       "%1$04d-%2$02d-%3$02d"          # a format string
#
# Destination reference selectors can be used on the right hand side to refer
# to a level of document structure that the left hand side (destination) will
# resolve to. If the left hand side is applied to several locations it can be
# used to read from the corresponding element in the document structure tree.
# They consist of a number sign (#) followed by the level. Examples:
#       #0                              # Equal to /
#       #1                              # Respective left hand side child
#       #2                              # Respective left hand side grandchild
#
# The following code copies the sort number from the first child to the top
# struct, given it does not yet have one, and the main title from the top
# struct to the first child, given it does not yet have one:
#
# /@CurrentNoSorting ""= /*[0]@CurrentNoSorting;/*[0]@TitleDocMain ""= /@TitleDocMain
#
# The following example copies the process id to a metadatum on the top-level
# document structure element (the metadatum must have been configured before):
#
# /@GoobiIdentifier = $process.id
#
# This example creates a metadatum DatePublished on each Issue of a newspaper,
# combining into it the metadata from its respective ancestors:
#
# /PublicationYear[0]/PublicationMonth[*]/PublicationDay[*]/Issue@DatePublished =format "%1$04d-%2$02d-%3$02d" #1@TitleDocMain #2@TitleDocMainShort #3@TitleDocMainShort
#copyData.onCatalogueQuery=/@CurrentNoSorting ""\= /*[0]@CurrentNoSorting;/*[0]@TitleDocMain ""\= /@TitleDocMain
#copyData.onExport=/@GoobiIdentifier \= $process.id;/PublicationYear[0]/PublicationMonth[*]/PublicationDay[*]/Issue@DatePublished \=format "%1$04d-%2$02d-%3$02d" #1@TitleDocMain #2@TitleDocMainShort #3@TitleDocMainShort

# Authority control configuration
# -----------------------------------
# To store authority records in MODS, an attribute named "authority" has to be
# recorded in the data file. Since you will only have to provide the norm data
# record itself in the Kitodo front end, a mapping from the base URL (also known
# as "authorityURI") to the named attribute "authority" must be provided. For
# the list of legal values, see:
# http://www.loc.gov/standards/sourcelist/name-title.html#codes
#
# The mapping must be provided in scheme: authority.<authorityURI>.id=<value>
# The colon as part of the HTTP URL must be escaped by a single backslash.
# For example, to map the URL "http://d-nb.info/gnd/" where the Integrated
# Authority File (GND) is published, to the abstract name "gnd", use:
# authority.http\://d-nb.info/gnd/.id=gnd
authority.http\://d-nb.info/gnd/.id=gnd
# You may want to specify the base URL of your preferred authority records
# database once here to have it pre-filled-in automatically in authority
# record input elements. For example, to use the Integrated Authority File
# (GND) as your preferred authority records database, use:
# authority.default=http\://d-nb.info/gnd/
