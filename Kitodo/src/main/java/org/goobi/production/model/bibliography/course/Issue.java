/**
 * The class Issue represents the regular appearance of one (or the) issue of a
 * newspaper.
 *
 * <p>
 * Newspapers, especially bigger ones, can have several issues that may differ
 * in time of publication (morning issue, evening issue, …), geographic
 * distribution (Edinburgh issue, London issue, …) and/or their days of
 * appearance (weekday issue: Mon—Fri, weekend issue: Sat, sports supplement:
 * Mon, property market: Wed, broadcasting programme: Thu). Furthermore there
 * may be exceptions in either that an issue didn’t appear on a date where, due
 * to the day of week, it usually does (i.e. on holidays) or an issue may have
 * appeared where, due to the day of week, it should not have.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each issue can be modeled by one Issue object each, which are held by a Block
 * object which provides the dates of first and last appearance.
