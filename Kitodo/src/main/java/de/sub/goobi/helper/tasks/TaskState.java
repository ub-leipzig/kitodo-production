 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt><code>CRASHED</code></dt>
 * <dd>The thread has terminated abnormally. The field “exception” is holding
 * the exception that has occurred.</dd>
 * <dt><code>FINISHED</code></dt>
 * <dd>The thread has finished its work without errors and is available for
 * clean-up.</dd>
 * <dt><code>NEW</code></dt>
 * <dd>The thread has not yet been started.</dd>
 * <dt><code>STOPPED</code></dt>
 * <dd>The thread was stopped by a front end user—resulting in a call to its
 * {@link EmptyTask#interrupt(Behaviour)} method with
 * {@link EmptyTask.Behaviour}.PREPARE_FOR_RESTART— and is able to restart after
 * cloning and replacing it.</dd>
 * <dt><code>STOPPING</code></dt>
 * <dd>The thread has received a request to interrupt but didn’t stop yet.</dd>
 * <dt><code>WORKING</code></dt>
 * <dd>The thread is in operation.</dd>
